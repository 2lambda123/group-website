  - title: "The British Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor: A reassessment with thermal hydraulic-neutronic coupling"
  description: We simulated a British reactor which, at the time of its construction, could have had either a positive or a negative reactivity coefficient. At the time, this was determined only experimentally - modern simulation tools and multiphysics showed that the reactivity coefficients are indeed negative and we explain why.

  - title: "Stability analysis of higher-order neutronics-depletion coupling schemes and Bateman operators"
  description: The stability of several common burn-up algorithms is analysed. This includes using realistic Bateman operators (namely CRAM) and chains of nuclides. This reveals several phenomena which had been noticed in simulations previously but had no easy justification.

    - title: "Accelerating Monte Carlo neutron transport by approximating thermal cross sections with functional forms"
 description: Low energy cross sections of many nuclides often have simple shapes. Rather than performing table look-ups and interpolations, we fit these to various functions and investigate the acceleration/accuracy trade-off of doing so.
